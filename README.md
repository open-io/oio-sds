## Install

Either you go from scratch (the source) or you download the packages for your Linux distribution, install, and run!

## Getting Started

There is one simple script to execute:

  ./tools/oio-reset.sh

And if it succeeds you will have the joy to experiment your own little SDS instance. No root privileges are required!

## Build

Please refer to [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md) for detailed information about how to compile and configure the solution.
